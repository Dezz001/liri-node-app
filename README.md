Currently my program is not working correctly. I've written all of the logic I believe will provide me with the correct or semi-correct results, however sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work as I continue to code. For example, my twitter code works but when I un comment the Spotify code twitter has challenges returning data. 

Currently Working:
	keys are working
	General Twitter dump works but conflicts with other code when attempting to produce results.
	General Spotify dump works but sometimes doesn't return all requested data.
	General OMDB dump works, i believe, but it is only returning IMDB Rating results.
	Do-What-It-Says works.
