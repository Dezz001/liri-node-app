Currently my program is mostly working correctly. I've written all of the logic I believe will provide me with the correct or semi-correct results, however sometimes it doesn't produce all expected results. Please see notes below: 

Notes:
	keys are working.
	General Twitter dump works and it displays in terminal.
	General Spotify dump works, it displays in terminal but doesn't return the artists.
	General OMDB dump works, i believe, it displays only IMDB Rating results in terminal.
	Do-What-It-Says works in terminal.
	I've decided to keep and commet out some of the code I had written for future reference and potential updates.
